# Optimization
I am taking a first course in Optimization from the text, [An Introduction to Optimization](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Optimization-Edwin-K-Chong/dp/1118279018) by Edwin Chong and Stanislaw Zak, Wiley Publications. I will try to implement various optimization algorithms and also study problems such as scheduling and TSP.
